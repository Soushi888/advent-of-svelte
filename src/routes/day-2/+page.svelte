		<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
			As the clock ticks down to Christmas Eve, Santa is preparing to eat all the cookies left by
			children all over the world. But amidst the holiday cheer, a small problem has arisen – how
			can we keep track of how many cookies Santa has munched!
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
			You’ve been tasked with creating a Cookie Counter which can show the tally of cookies munched.
			We should also be able to add, remove, and reset the count. Svelte Bot, in it’s wisdom,
			recommends exploring the dynamic world of Svelte transitions/animations to level up your
			creation.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-lg">
			If you’re up for it, you could consider adding a feature that shows Santa’s mood based on the
			number of cookies eaten – maybe he gets a little merrier with each cookie!
